Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make MetroSim
     - run executable with
            ./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]

Program Purpose:

This homework assignment handles a running train to accommodate passengers 
arriving at a station, riding the metro, and departing at their destination. 
The purpose was to design and create an implementation to modularize
code and work with documented libraries. To accomplish this, this program uses
vectors of structs and queues.

Acknowledgements: 
Thank you to Professor Sheldon for his videos on queues and for answering
questions on the online forum. I learned about vectors from the website:
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/. I learned about using 
files in C++ programs with "How to interact with files in C++" by Matias 
Korman, Supriya Sanjay, Ranjit Thomas, and Professor Sheldon. 
Thanks to the many TA's who helped me during office hours:
    Juliana - for helping me with my make file.
    Akash - for helping me plan out my program at the beginning.
    Julia - for helping me make a clearer plan after getting started.
    Daniel - for helping me figure out which functions should be public or 
        private and for helping me visualize the train with its list of 
        PassengerQueues.
    Ryan - for helping me understand the input value for print() and how it 
        works between files, cout, and cerr.
    Kevin - for helping me debug my initializeTrain function write to the 
        output file. 
    Mateo - for helping me figure out which functions should be in my main.cpp
        and which should be in my MetroSim.cpp.
    Elise - for helping me figure out why my program was executing one more
        metro move than it was supposed to.

Files: 

main.cpp:
    Driver file for MetroSim, PassengerQueue, and Passenger classes. Contains
    main() function, reads in files, and executes the simulation.

MetroSim.h:
    Interface of MetroSim class. Declares the public and private functions and 
    member variables of the MetroSim class.
        
MetroSim.cpp:
    Implementation of MetroSim class. Includes key functions allowing the user
    to interact with a metro simulation. Deals with passengers going on/off 
    the train. Functions include: default constructor, destructor, 
    initializeStations, printTrain, printMap, askForInstructions,
    executeInstructions, initializeTrain, addPassenger, metroMove, embark,
    disembark, nextStationInd, writeOutput, readInStations, findDirections, 
    readInstructions.
    Also includes struct definitions: instruction, station, train.

PassengerQueue.h:
    Interface of PassengerQueue class. Declares public and private functions 
    and member variables of the PassengerQueue class.

PassengerQueue.cpp:
    Implementation of the PassengerQueue class. Contains definitions of key
    functions that allow the user interact with and modify PassengerQueues.
    Functions include: default constructor, destructor, front, back,
    dequeue, enqueue, print, createPassenger.

Passenger.h:
    Interface of Passenger class. Contains definition of struct Passenger.

Passenger.cpp:
    Implementation of the Passenger class. Contains function print().

testFile.cpp:
    Test driver file for MetroSim, PassengerQueue, and Passenger classes. 
    Contains main() and functions for unit testing functions among those 3 
    classes.

stations.txt:
    A file listing example station names.
        
textStations.txt:
    A file listing 5 example station names used for unit testing.

test_commands.txt:
    Sample list of commands to give the simulator to execute.

Data Structures:
    The data structures used in this program were vectors and queues. An 
    advantage of using vectors is that their size can change dynamically. 
    This is very convenient and more efficient than arrays for example as
    data doesn't need to be copied from one array to the other. Vectors
    also have ordered elements, which make it easier for users to access
    elements/data located in the middle of the vector compared to linked lists.
    A disadvantage of using vectors is that since their size can change
    dynamically, they allocate extra room for the potential growth, and this 
    consumes more memory.
    
    Queues use FIFO — first in, first out. An advantage to using queues are 
    it's easy to access and modify the elements at the end of the queue. 
    Elements in the queue are ordered and the size does not have to be 
    allocated beforehand like arrays. A disadvantage is that it's difficult 
    to access elements that are not at the ends. Queues' main functionality is
    to enqueue/dequeue, so the elements in the middle cannot be altered easily.

Testing:

Here describe the following: process of testing (unit tests), mention
of bugs you encountered while testing, mention of testing on inputs of
different sizes and edge cases, good description of base cases you
considered while testing. Demonstrate a methodical approach to
testing.  This section of your REAMDE should be very thorough for
homework assignments.

Note: This homework comes partially implemented, but student must also
create the driver and add class functionality.

printTrain private function
