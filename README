Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make MetroSim
     - run executable with
            ./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]

Program Purpose:

This homework assignment handles a running train to accomodate
passengers arriving/departing a metro. Learn how to design and
modularize code and work with documented libraries.

Files: 

main.cpp:
    Driver file for MetroSim, PassengerQueue, and Passenger classes. Contains
    main() function, reads in files, and executes the simulation. 

MetroSim.cpp:
     STUDENT TO-DO: Implementation of MetroSim class.  Main
     functionality of running the Metro Simulation, should be able to
     move trains and deal with passengers going on/off the train.

MetroSim.h:
        STUDENT TO-DO: Interface of MetroSim class.

stations.txt:
        an example file containing a list of stations.

test_commands.txt:
        sample list of commands that you could give to the simulator

the_metroSim:
        reference implementation for students to see how 
        
README: 
        This file.


Note:  the program should handle all cases.

Data Structures:


Testing:

Here describe the following: process of testing (unit tests), mention
of bugs you encountered while testing, mention of testing on inputs of
different sizes and edge cases, good description of base cases you
considered while testing. Demonstrate a methodical approach to
testing.  This section of your REAMDE should be very thorough for
homework assignments.

Note: This homework comes partially implemented, but student must also
create the driver and add class functionality.
